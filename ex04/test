The Hog 2.6 deck in Clash Royale is one of the most classic and skill-based cycle decks in the game. 
It’s called “2.6” because of its average elixir cost of 2.6, allowing you to cycle through your cards extremely quickly.
The deck typically includes:
Hog Rider – your main win condition, used to pressure and chip away at towers.
Musketeer – your main air and ranged defense.
Cannon – cheap and reliable ground defense, great against tanks.
Skeletons and Ice Spirit – cycle cards that provide distraction and value for just 1 elixir.
Ice Golem – a mini tank that supports the Hog push and helps on defense with its death slow.
Fireball and Log – your main spells for clearing swarms and support troops.
The strategy revolves around constant pressure and fast cycling. 
You defend efficiently, then counterattack with a Hog + Ice Golem push while quickly getting back to your defensive cards. 
Mastering timing, elixir management, and placement is key — the 2.6 deck rewards precision and control more than brute force.
